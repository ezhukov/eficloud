  title : Not another DevOps company
  content : "In the era of digitalization and cloudification it is hard to pick a cloud provider. It is even harder to pick a consultancy firm to help with all of that.

Our approach is to focus on the application first, gather usage data, perform certain amount and type of testing. Only then we can recommend, design and help implement the infrastructure."
